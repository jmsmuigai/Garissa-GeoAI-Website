# üöÄ Garissa GeoAI: A Vision for a Resilient Future

This repository contains the source for a modern, interactive landing page showcasing the "GeoAI for a Resilient Garissa" initiative. The page is designed to look and feel like the VSCode editor, providing an engaging and informative experience for visitors, stakeholders, and potential partners.

It is a self-contained `index.html` file with no external dependencies besides Font Awesome for icons.

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

## üåê Deploying to GitHub Pages (Live Link)

Follow these steps to publish your page to a live, shareable URL.

### 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

Go to your GitHub account and create a new public repository. You can name it `Garissa-GeoAI-Website` or any other name you prefer. **Do not** initialize it with a README or any other files.

### 2. Push Your Local Files to GitHub

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `Garissa-GeoAI-Website` directory on your computer, and run the following commands one by one.

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to be tracked
git add .

# Commit the files with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Launch Garissa GeoAI landing page"

# Add your new GitHub repository as the remote origin
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/jmsmuigai/Garissa-GeoAI-Website.git

# Push your code to the main branch on GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Activate GitHub Pages

1.  In your new repository on GitHub, go to **Settings**.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3.  Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
4.  Under "Branch", select `main` and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
5.  Click **Save**.

GitHub will now build and deploy your site. After a minute or two, your live, shareable link will be displayed on this same page. It will look something like this:

**`https://jmsmuigai.github.io/Garissa-GeoAI-Website/`**
